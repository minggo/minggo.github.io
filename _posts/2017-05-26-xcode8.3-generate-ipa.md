Before Xcode 8.3, can use `xcrun PackageApplication` to generate IPA, but `PackageApplication` is removed since Xcode 8.3, so should use another way to generate IPA. This doc will describe how to generate IPA with Xcode 8.3+. 

According to the [ticket](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39674237/xcrun-command-to-export-ipa-file-xcode8-for-iphoneos10-0), the new method includes two steps:

* generate .xcarchive
* generate IPA from .xcarchive

`-exportOptionsPlist` is needed when using `xcodebuild` command to export IPA. The plist file pointed by `-exportOptionsPlist` can have many keys. Only the key `method` is needed, `teamID` don't have to be set if it is the same as generating `.xcarchive`.

Can refer to [the PR](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-console/pull/421) for detail information about how this new method work.
